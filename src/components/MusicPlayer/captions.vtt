They're the tunes you've probably
heard once or twice.


00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.000 size: 33%
But never quite like this.


00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.920
(DESPACITO BY LUIS FONSI IN IRISH)


00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.960
(CHEERLEADER BY OMI IN IRISH)


00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.320
(WAKE ME UP BY AVICII IN IRISH)


00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.960
Yeah, singing along
to these guys' covers


00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.440
might be a little trickier than usual


00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.800
because they're singing them all
in Irish Gaelic!


00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.920
(SONG CONTINUES)


00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.440
Irish Gaelic,
or just Irish as they call it,


00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.880
is the first official language
of the Republic of Ireland.


00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.920
You see, up until the 18th century
it was the main language


00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.600
spoken throughout the country.


00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.080
But, over time, English took over
and Irish started to die out.


00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.720
(ALL SPEAK IN IRISH)


00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.800
These days it's not spoken
in many areas.


00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.280
And while lots of students
still learn it at school,


00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.520
they mostly speak English
as their first language.


00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.600
It is going down.
Not as many people speak it anymore.


00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.360
Lots of people are worried that
if something isn't done now


00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.400
to save it,
the language could be lost for good.


00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240
That's where these guys come in.


00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.200
They're part of a special
summer school program


00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.160
in the Galway Gaeltacht,
one of the last places in Ireland


00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.680
where Irish is still spoken
as a first language.


00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.360
I'm bilingual but I am more
comfortable in the Irish language.


00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120
Everybody that I know speaks Irish,


00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.080
so I speak Irish
probably 80% of the time.


00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.560
The program is all about taking
famous songs


00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.520
and translating them into Irish.


00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.600
They then make their own music videos
and upload them onto YouTube,


00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.280
where they've racked up
millions of views.


00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.120
(SINGS IN IRISH GAELIC)


00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.320
Each year we get
more and more ambitious


00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.080
and try and make them
better and bigger.


00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.480
It's such a great feeling
to see the videos


00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.960
been so popular on YouTube
because we worked so hard on them


00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.960
during the three weeks
and to see such a good reaction


00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.600
from the public just makes everyone
feel so great about it.


00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.760
These guys reckon making Irish
more popular is really important


00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.360
and they're hoping that their videos
will encourage those


00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.800
with Irish blood in their veins to
start using the language once again.


00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.280
It's a great opportunity
for teenagers to socialise


00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.040
with teenagers from around
the country,


00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.000
while also engaging
with the Irish language.


00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.120
I think these music videos
really encourage other young people


00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.520
to speak in Irish.


00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.440
My sister herself struggles a lot
with the spoken language


00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.160
and when she sees me and my brothers
in these videos,


00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.480
she just takes it upon herself
to learn them


00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.360
and then asks me
what these different words mean.


00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.920
Then it just has her kind of
know the language herself then.


00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.440
(HELLO BY ADELE)


00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.880
These guys say they're proud
to be doing their part


00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520
to help this historical language
live on.
