Yeah, singing along
to these guys' covers


00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.440 line:50%
might be a little trickier than usual


00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.800 line:50%
because they're singing them all

Irish Gaelic,
or just Irish as they call it,


00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.880 line:50%
is the first official language
of the Republic of Ireland.


00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.920 line:50%
You see, up until the 18th century
it was the main language


00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.600 line:50%
spoken throughout the country.


00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.080 line:50%
But, over time, English took over
and Irish started to die out.

(ALL SPEAK IN IRISH)


00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.800 line:50%
These days it's not spoken
in many areas.

And while lots of students
still learn it at school,


00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.520 line:50%
they mostly speak English
as their first language.


00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.600 line:50%
It is going down.
Not as many people speak it anymore.


00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.360 line:50%
Lots of people are worried that
if something isn't done now


00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.400 line:50%
to save it,
the language could be lost for good.


00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240 line:50%

I'm bilingual but I am more
comfortable in the Irish language.


00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120 line:50%
Everybody that I know speaks Irish,


00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.080 line:50%
so I speak Irish
probably 80% of the time.


00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.560 line:50%
The program is all about taking
famous songs


00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.520 line:50%
and translating them into Irish.


00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.600  line:50%
They then make their own music videos
and upload them onto YouTube,


00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.280 line:50%

been so popular on YouTube
because we worked so hard on them


00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.960 line:50%
during the three weeks
and to see such a good reaction


00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.600 line:50%
from the public just makes everyone

My sister herself struggles a lot
with the spoken language


00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.160 line:50%
and when she sees me and my brothers
in these videos,


00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.480 line:50%
she just takes it upon herself
to learn them


00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.360 line:50%
and then asks me
what these different words mean.


00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.920 line:50%
Then it just has her kind of
know the language herself then.
